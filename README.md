# Scanned-Document-Classification
BFSI sectors deal with lots of unstructured scanned documents which are archived in document management systems for further use.For example in Insurance sector, when a policy goes for underwriting, underwriters attached several raw notes with the policy, Insureds also attach various kind of scanned documents like identity card, bank statement, letters etc. In later parts of the policy life cycle if claims are made on a policy, releted scanned documents also archeived.Now it becomes a tedious job to identify a particular document from this vast repository. The goal of this case study is to develop a deep learning based solution which can automatically classify scanned documents.
